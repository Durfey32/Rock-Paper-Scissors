We will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that allows a user to play against the computer.

When we open the browser, we are prompted to enter a choice: R, P, or S.

When we have entered the letter and pressed OK, we are alerted to the computer's choice.

After we press OK, we are alerted whether we won, tied, or lost. 

When we press OK again, we are alerted to the stats.

When we press OK a final time, we are presented with the prompt "Play Again?"

If we press OK, the game starts again. If not, we exit the game.
